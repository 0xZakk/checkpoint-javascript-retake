// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations

// #1: Define a `Group` class with the following specifications:
// - a `name` property that is a string determined by some input (passed into the constructor)
// - a `members` property that is an empty array not determined by input (not passed into the constructor)
// - an `addMember` method that adds a person (string) to the `members` array
// Type your solution immediately below this line:





// #2: Create an instance of the Group class and set it to a variable called `classmates`
// Call the instance's `addMember` method to add a person to the instance's `members` array
// Type your solution immediately below this line:





// NOTE: THE CODE BELOW IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES. DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER.
