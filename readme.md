## Pro Tip: Test Your Code

You should first test your code's functionality in the browser console via the included `index.html` file.  

Once you think your code is correct, you can run the tests that will evaluate your solutions to double-check them.

To do so, first install the testing packages...

```bash
 $ npm install
```

Then call the test runner each time you want to check your code...

```bash
 $ npm test
```
